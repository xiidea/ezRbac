How To Install
==============
Installation of this library is simple 4 steps

1. Put **ezRbac** in the **third_party** Directory of your application

2. Run the sqls in schema directory or create three tables in your database manually.

3. Set <code>$config['enable_hooks'] = TRUE;</code> at **./application/config/config.php**

4. Add a hook in **./application/config/hooks.php**

```php
    $hook['post_controller_constructor'] = array(
            'class' => 'ezRbacHook',
            'function' => 'AccessCheck',
            'filename' => 'ezRbacHook.php',
            'filepath' => 'third_party/ezRbac'
        );
```


ezRbac Specific URL
===================
logout url : <code>/index.php/welcome/index/rbac/logout</code>

acl manage url : <code>/index.php/welcome/index/rbac/gui</code>

If you have enabled the routing(see **How to eneable Routing**) then you can access all url like <code> /rbac/(logout|gui)</code>

How to enable Routing
======================
Its easy to enable with 2 steps

1. Set <code>$config['use_routing'] = true;</code> at **./ezRbac/config/ez_rbac.php**

2. set <code>$route['^(rbac)/(.+)$'] = $route['default_controller']."/index/$1/$2"; </code> at **/application/config/routes.php** (where **rbac** can be replaced whatever you like by setting the <code>$config['ezrbac_url'] = 'rbac';</code>)

Customization
=============
Most of the customization can be done through setting configuration values. you can customize configuration in two ways:

1. (The Easy way) Modify the configuration to match with your choice at **./third_party/ezRbac/config/ez_rbac.php**
2. (The Advanced way) Make a copy of **./third_party/ezRbac/config/ez_rbac.php** as **./application/config/ez_rbac.php** or Create new file to override the default settings. These way whenever you do update the library, you do not need to worry about your configuration values.

You can override the view file also. just copy the view files into **/application/views/ezrbac/** and modify as per your need. Currently only views in **login** directory is extensible.


Dependencies
============
To use this library you need **Codeigniter 2.1**
